code recipes are from [here](http://booksdescr.org/item/index.php?md5=A54733C00C5BE4B15C3707A893F8C895)
* check its repo [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/TensorFlow-1x-Deep-Learning-Cookbook/tree/master/Chapter09)

you will need openai [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) (and maybe [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/))
* i recommend you to install everything (`pip install --user 'gym[all]'`), but first you need to install [mujoco](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco)

go on and read the instructions

### install mujoco and gym

1. get the license [here](https://www.roboti.us/license.html)
 - in `computer id` you have to put the code generated by the execution of the program/script located at the right side (win32, win64, osx)
 - before, probably you will need to give it permission to execute `chmod u+x Downloads/getid_linux`
 - then, we have

```bash
lativ in [~]  
 21:18:26 Î» ./Downloads/getid_linux 

Your MuJoCo computer id is:

   LINUX_0000000000000000_00000000000

Please send this string to Roboti LLC to generate activation key.

Press Enter to exit...
```

2. after, create a directory `~/.mujoco` and move the key `mv Downloads/mjkey.txt .mujoco` you downloaded (check your email)
3. next, unzip `mjpro150` that you downloaded ([here](https://www.roboti.us/download/mjpro150_linux.zip) for linux) into `~/.mujoco/`
4. add to `.bashrc` (or similar, like `.zshrc`): `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.mujoco/mjpro150/bin`
4. finally, install it `$ pip install --user 'mujoco-py<1.50.2,>=1.50.1'`

now you need to install [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) (check it)
